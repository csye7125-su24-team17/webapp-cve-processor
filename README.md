# Webapp CVE Processor

This repository contains the source code for the Webapp CVE Processor, a Go application designed to process CVE data and store it in a PostgreSQL database with versioning support. It includes database migration scripts managed by Flyway.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Go (1.18 or newer): [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- PostgreSQL (latest version): [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Flyway for database migration: [Download Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/download/)
- Git (for version control): [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Ensure the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables are set according to your Go installation.

## Building the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csye7125-su24-team17/webapp-cve-processor.git
   cd webapp-cve-processor

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   Copy the .env.example to .env and adjust the database connection strings and other configurations as necessary.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o cve-processor ./cmd

## Building the Application

1. Database Setup:
   - Start your PostgreSQL server and create a database named cve.
   - Modify the flyway.conf to match your database connection details.
  
2. Run Database Migrations:
   - Navigate to the migrations directory.
   - Execute Flyway migrations to set up your database schema
        ```bash
        flyway migrate

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./cve-processor

This command starts the CVE Processor, which will begin processing the CVE JSON files from the specified directory.

## Additional Information

1. Directory Structure: The cmd directory contains the main application logic. The pkg directory includes essential packages, and the migrations directory contains SQL scripts for database migrations with flyway.

2. Contributing: Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests to the main branch.
